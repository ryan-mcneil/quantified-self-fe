Quantified Self is an application that allows users to track calorie intake.  Foods and their corresponding calories are added to a database via a simple input form.  Foods can then be added to any of four defined meals: breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack.  Consumed calories are summarized by meal and day.

Users are also able to add daily and meal goals, helping them track progress throughout the day.  In addition to subtotals for calories consumed for each meal, remaining calories are also displayed based on the goals entered for that meal. Daily total calories consumed, the user's daily goal, and their difference are displayed and updated as foods are added to meals throughout the day.
